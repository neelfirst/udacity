    "Decision trees have complexity O(n), its main advantage is that it can produce simple and easy to understand rules that govern student graduation rates. It is also fast and easy to run. However they are susceptible to overfitting, that is they can fit the training data well, but less so with the test data.\n",

AdaBoost can synthesize many weak learners obeying simple decision rules into a more powerful and accurate high-level classifier. However their execution time increases with the variety of features we have produced, especially by splitting the data into Boolean features.\n",

    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",

    "The most appropriate model for predicting student graduation is the SVM. It does not have the maximal performance on training data (DecisionTree is faster and more accurate on training data), but it does have the best score at handling unseen data (the F1 score on test set). We will want an algorithm with cheap training time and whose score is not very sensitive to different data set sizes (supposing we have a limited amount of data).\n",

    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that attempts to find the ideal 'dividing line' that separates passing students from failing students. This algorithm operates over our feature space, which is the full space of possibilities described by all possible combinations of student features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use training data - students described by a set of features, along with their known graduation outcomes, to generate such a dividing line. We then use test data - students the algorithm has not seen, along with their known graduation outcomes - to evaluate how well it predicts if those given students passes or fails to graduate. The SVM generates a prediction simply by observing which side of the dividing line a test point falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a correction factor built into this algorithm, that makes it more or less tolerant of outliers, or students who don't fit the general trends. A less tolerant machine will find a more complex shape to divide all training points with maximal accuracy, while a more tolerant SVM will choose a simpler shape at the expense of incorrectly classifying some points. This SVM has C = 1, which is more tolerant of outliers.\n",
